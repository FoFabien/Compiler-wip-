# Compiler prototype written in python (WIP).  
Goals:  
- Compile pseudo C code into op codes  
- Minimalistic and fast  
- Load compiled/un-compiled code and run it on the fly  
- Port the prototype to C/C++ once it's done  
  
To do:  
- Array support  
- Code optimization at compile time  
- Error checking (current one is minimalistic and/or outdated)  
- Loop and If support  
- Run the code  
- Some sort of debug feature?
- And probably a lot more.
